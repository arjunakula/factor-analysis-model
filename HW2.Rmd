## Problem 1

Given that $X$ is orthonormal, 

$$so, (X^TX=XX^T = I) \: \& \: (n=m) \\$$
$$ => X^{-1} = X^T$$

$$
P = XX^T\\
=> P  = X(X^{-1})\\
=> P  = I_{nXm} \\
$$
Therefore, trace of $P$ = sum of diagonal elements in $I$ = $1+1+...+\{m\:times\}$ = m.


## Problem 2

Given A is a positive definite matrix of dimensions nXn.

Let $$A =\left[\begin{array}
{r r}
A_{11}\: A_{12} \\
A_{21}\: A_{22}\\
\end{array}\right]
$$

Let $A_{11}$ is a mXm matrix, where m is less than n.

Suppose if $x_{1Xm}$ is not zero and y = ($x_{1Xm}^T$, $0^T_{1Xn-m})^T$,

$y^TAy > 0$

$$=>x^TA_{11}x > 0$$, which means $A_{11}$ is positive definite.
Similarly we can show that $A_{22}$ is also a postive definite.

If there is just one column in $A_{11}$, then that element ($a_{11}$) has to be greater than 0. 
With the same argument, $a_{22}$ is greater than 0 in $A_{22}$.
We can generalize this as $a_{ii}$ > 0

Now, if y is $(-A_{12}*x/a_{11}, x^T)^T$, then $y^TAy > 0$. If we analyze this closely (as i couldn't show this properly in rmd document), we can see that $A_{22}-A_{21}a_{11}^{-1}A_{12} > 0$, which basically says that we can indeed construct a upper triangular matrix Z such that $A = Z^TZ$
Now, we just need to prove that Z is unique.

Let say we can construct another matrix B like Z.

As $Z^TZ = A = B^TB$, $z_{11}^2 = b_{11}^2 = a_{11}$. That means $z_{11} = b_{11}$.
In the same manner, we can show that $z_{ii} = b_{ii}$. Hence Z is unique.












## Problem 3
Let $u_1$,$u_2$ and $u_3$ be the orthonormal basis for $v_1$,$v_2$ and $v_3$.

## Problem 4

(a)
A - C = (A - B) + (B - C)

=> $x^T(A-C)x$ = $x^T(A - B)x + x^T(B - C)x$

since A-B is positive semi-definite, $x^T(A - B)x >= 0$, for all x

since B-C is positive semi-definite, $x^T(B - C)x >= 0$, for all x

Hence, $x^T(A-C)x >= 0$, i.e. A-C is also positive semi-definite.

(b)
since A-B is positive semi-definite, $x^T(A - B)x >= 0$, for all x

since B-A is positive semi-definite, $x^T(B - A)x >= 0$, for all x

From above two conditions, it is clear that $x^T(A - B)x = 0$, i.e. A-B = 0 => A=B

## Problem 5
(a)

As A, B are positive definite matrices, they both will have positive definite square roots. so we can write A as $A_1^2$ and B as $B_1^2$.

A-B is positive defnite 

$=> x^T(A-B)x > 0$

$=> x^TAx > x^TBx$

$=> xx^TAxx^T > xx^TBxx^T$

$=> A > B$

$=> B_1^{-1}A > B_1^{-1}B$

$=> B_1^{-1}AB_1^{-1} > B_1^{-1}BB_1^{-1}$

$=> B_1^{-1}AB_1^{-1} > B_1^{-1}B_1B_1B_1^{-1}$

$=> B_1^{-1}AB_1^{-1} > I$

$=> B_1A^{-1}B_1 < I^{-1}$

$=> B_1^{-1}B_1A^{-1}B_1B_1^{-1} < B_1^{-1}IB_1^{-1}$

$=> A^{-1} < B^{-1}$

$=>(B^{-1}-A^{-1})$ is positive definite

(b)
Using cholesky decomposition, let A = $XX^T$ and B = $YY^T$

 $A^{-1} = X^{-T}X^{-1}$

 $B^{-1} = Y^{-T}Y^{-1}$
 
 The eigen value for $Y^{-1}XX^TY^{-T}$ is >= 1. Moreover, $Y^{-1}XX^TY^{-T}$ and $XX^TY^{-T}Y^{-1}$ have same eigen values. 
 
 Hence det($AB^{-1}$) = det($Y^{-1}XX^TY^{-T}$) >= 1 (as determinant = product of eigen values). This implies that det(A) >= det(B)
 
 All the elements of (A-B) are >= 0, otherwise the condition $x^T(A-B)x > 0$ may not hold true. So, the sum of all diagonal elements is positive as the individual element is positive. Hence trace (A-B) >= 0 => tr(A) >= tr(B).
 

## Problem 6

$$\lim_{k\to\infty}A^K = 0$$

$A = XDX^T$

$A^k = XD^kX^T$

 $$=>\lim_{k\to\infty}XD^KX^T = 0$$
The limit will be zero only if values of diagonal matrix reduce at every interation. That is possible only if values elements in D (|d1|, |d2|, etc) are less than 1. (otherwise the values will explode)

Hence |$d_i$| < 1


## Problem 7

$A = UDV^T$

$$(1/\sqrt{2})\left[\begin{array}
{r r}
VD\:\:\: -VD \\
UD\:\:\: UD\\
\end{array}\right]
(1/\sqrt{2})\left[\begin{array}
{r r}
V^T\:\:\: U^T \\
V^T\:\:\: -U^T\\
\end{array}\right]
$$

$$= (1/2)\left[\begin{array}
{r r}
0\:\:\: VDU^T \\
UDV^T\:\:\: 0\\
\end{array}\right]
$$


$$ = \left[\begin{array}
{r r}
0\:\:\: A^T \\
A\:\:\: 0\\
\end{array}\right]
$$
